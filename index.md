## What is Ambra?

Ambra is an Open Source platform for publishing [Open Access][oa] research articles. It provides features for post-publication discussion and versioned articles that allows for a “living” document around which further scientific discoveries can be made. It is licensed under the MIT License.

## What is the status of Ambra?

PLOS (Public Library of Science) no longer actively develops Ambra, but maintains it as its operating platform for the full catalog of PLOS journals:
 
With PLOS focus moving away from Ambra, the platform itself is not likely to be the ideal starting point for a new journal or publishing system. However, it remains viable, and its purposeful design toward solving open access scholarly communication problems may serve as a point of inspiration for future platforms.
